Currently, I am looking for full time employment. I have been searching high and just can't find a suitable position in my area. I am not opposed to moving to find a job, so this idea came to me when I started looking for  jobs in different cities near and far from me.  That is when relocateMe was born. I wanted to create an app that would give me a list of jobs  as well as letting me know more information about the place I would potentially be moving to. I pulled together two api's that would give me jobs as well as city information. This will be a project that I will revisit and continue to refine.
